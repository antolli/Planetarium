# Planetarium

This is my final project to "User Experience" class, taken during my - suffered - master's degree in Computer Sciences. It is very simple but for me it is really attractive, because I chose every single item with so much love "<3" and in somehow this has been descriptive, you know, it's illustrating my likings, style, etc.
